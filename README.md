👋 Hi, 你好.
I'm Yunze and I'm glad you found me here. Some quick facts about me:

💼 Work
---

- 🤖 I'm currently working at a Sydney based tech company called [Dovetail](https://dovetail.com/), recently on it's [AI features](https://dovetail.com/blog/ai-vision/) using LLMs.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I built the latest version of Dovetail's Gatsby marketing website, along with 2 other colleagues.

💻 Outside of Work
---
- 🌐 I like to build full-stack web apps, mostly clones but every once in a while original. My employment history says I'm a frontend engineer and that's by choice, I can go full stack.
- 3️⃣ I'm interested in computer graphics on the web, [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org/), `WebGL`, [`three.js`](https://threejs.org/), [`R3F`](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) and [`visx`](https://airbnb.io/visx/) are some libraries I love.
